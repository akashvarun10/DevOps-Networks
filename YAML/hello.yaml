--- # this is a separator, YAML will know these are different documents

# lists
- apple  
- mango
- banana
- Apple
# YAML is case sensitive 

--- # this is a separator, YAML will know these are different documents

#Block style datatype
cities:
- new york
- boston

---
# spaces and indentation are important in YAML

cities:[new york, boston]
# this is a single line representation of the above block style
#it's a flow style

{
    "name": "Akash",
    "age": 21,
    "city": "New York"
}
... # to end the document

# So, YAML is a collection of 0 or more documents. Each document is a collection of key-value pairs.
